HERE ON THIS LEVEL
HIDING SOMEWHERE NEAR,
IS A MONSTER THAT SHOULD
FILL YOU WITH FEAR!

FIND THE SHADOW DRAGON-
FLY.
A LITTLE BIRD SAYS:
SOMEWHERE AROUND HERE
WAITING TO DINE,
IS A SHADOW MINI-DRAGON
THAT FAVORS YOUR KIND.

YOU (ACTUALLY, THEY'RE
NOT).
A LITTLE BIRD SAYS:
A TREASURE GREAT
LIES HERE WITHIN,
IF IN A GREAT FIGHT
WITH A DRAGON YOU WIN!

A BEGINNER YOU'RE NOT
TO HAVE THIS FAR REACHED,
TO BATTLE A KING
AND BRING DOWN DEFEAT!
   THIS IS THE BEGINNER'S
VERSION'S FINAL BATTLE.
HAVE YOU REGISTERED?
A LITTLE BIRD SAYS:
YOU ARE A GREAT POWER
ONE CAN NOT DENY,
BUT WAIT TILL YOU
MEET THE RED DRAGONFLY!
   NOTE THAT RED DRAGONS
MAY TEND TO EAT YOUR LIFE
FORCE.
A LITTLE BIRD SAYS:
DID YOU UNDERESTIMATE
THE RED DRAGONFLY?
THIS MONSTER YOU WON'T
LEST YOU SHOULD DIE!
   RED IS MY FAVORITE
COLOR. THAT'S WHY THEY'RE
SO MEAN.
A LITTLE BIRD SAYS:
RED MAJOR DRAGONS
ARE FUN GUYS TO KILL
BUT SOON A NICE COFFIN
YOUR BODY MAY FILL!
   I HOPE YOU DON'T
TEND TO BRUISE TOO
EASILY.

TOUGH IS THE MONSTER
YOU'RE ABOUT TO FACE.
THE TOUGHEST, IN FACT,
IN THE ENTIRE PLACE!
   YOU CAN KEEP PLAYING

A LITTLE MOUSE SAYS:
THERE IS A HUGE NETWORK
OF TRAP DOORS LEADING
FROM POINT TO POINT
AROUND THIS DUNGEON. TO
USE THESE TRAP DOORS,
YOU MUST FIND ONE KEY
FOR EACH TEN LEVELS.
A LITTLE MOUSE SAYS:
TRAP DOOR KEYS CAN BE
FOUND ONLY BY KILLING
LEVEL DRAINERS. LEVEL
DRAINERS CAN BE KILLED
WITH SPELLS LIKE AUTOKILL,
GO AWAY, MAJOR SHOCK,
ETC.
A LITTLE MOUSE SAYS:
TO OBTAIN A KEY FOR LEVELS
20-29, FOR EXAMPLE, KILL
A LEVEL DRAINER ON LEVEL
20-29. NOT EVERY LEVEL
DRAINER HAS A KEY, BUT
MANY DO. THE TRAP DOORS
WERE BUILT BY THEM.
A LITTLE MOUSE SAYS:
LEVEL DRAINERS ALSO TEND
TO CARRY VITAMIN PILLS,
WHICH CAN GREATLY IMPROVE
YOUR CHARACTERISTICS.
LEVEL DRAINERS ALSO GIVE
MUCH HIGHER EXPERIENCE
THAN OTHER MONSTERS.

MONSTER AND EACH ONE HAS
A USEFUL AND POWERFUL
MAGIC ITEM.

THE SPECIAL ITEMS SHADOW
DRAGONS CARRY WILL MAKE
YOU MUCH MORE POWERFUL.
BUT BE PREPARED FOR
SERIOUS BATTLE, THESE
DRAGONS ARE ABSOLUTELY
RUTHLESS!
A LITTLE MOUSE SAYS:
THE ADVANCED VERSION HAS
