Game Requirements
ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß

Vinyl Goddess From Mars requires:
        --> VGA graphics card.
        --> 560K (570,680 bytes) of free conventional RAM.
        --> Hard drive.
        --> 386DX or better ( 486 for best playablity ).

Supports:
        --> Adlib/Sound Blaster compatible music track.
        --> Sound Blaster compatible digitized sound effects.
        --> Joystick or gamepad.

Setup
ßßßßß

Before you can start Vinyl Goddess From Mars, you must run SETUP in order to 
configure your sound card and game control device.  To start the SETUP 
program:
        Switch to the drive and directory that contains the GODDESS.EXE file.  
        For example:
                C:
                CD \VINYL

        Type SETUP.

** NOTE: The SETUP program only needs to be run the first time you play, or **
**       any time that you want to CHANGE your configuration.               **

Starting The Game
ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß

Starting From MS-DOS
--------------------
Once you have setup your sound card and chosen a game control device using 
the SETUP program, you're ready to run the game.  Get into the directory
where you have installed Vinyl Goddess From Mars ( e.g. CD \VINYL ) and type
GODDESS.

Running the Game From Windows
-----------------------------
We do not recommend running Vinyl Goddess From Mars from Microsoft Windows.
Windows requires too many system resources to allow Vinyl Goddess to play
fast and smooth.  You should exit Windows and run the game from DOS 
instead.  To exit Windows, use the 'File' menu in the Program Manager and 
select 'Exit Windows...'.

If, however, you must launch Vinyl Goddess from the Windows environment, use
the GODDESS.PIF as opposed to GODDESS.EXE.  When playing Vinyl Goddess under
Windows, you may find that the game:
        A. You may notice the game slows down slightly.
        B. You will see a slight scrolling 'flick' from time to time.
        C. Your keyboard actions may be slightly delayed.

Running the Game From OS/2
--------------------------
We recommend that you run Vinyl Goddess From Mars from DOS only.  However, 
if you decide to run the game from OS/2, here are a few settings to try.
These settings allow Vinyl Goddess to run on our machines using OS/2 Warp.

of OS/2 and your specific computer configuration.

Not Enough Memory
ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß

Vinyl Goddess From Mars requires at least 560K of free DOS memory.  When you
run the program, it will check how much memory is available and exit if there
is insufficient memory to play the game.  The message will look something 
like this:
        
        This program requires at least xxxxxx bytes of memory to run.

1.  If you are using a DOS Shell, exit from this shell and run the game
    from DOS only.

2.  If you are launching Vinyl Goddess from Windows and get a memory error,
    you must exit Windows and run the game from DOS only.

3.  If you are completely in DOS and still do not have enough free memory
    to run the game, you must either boot your computer clean or unload some 
    of your TSR's and/or device drivers.  We'll tackle booting your computer 
    clean.

Booting clean using DOS 6.00 or better
--------------------------------------
MS DOS 6.00 has a special built in function that makes it very easy to boot 
your computer clean.  When first booting your computer, MS DOS will 
display the message "Starting MS-DOS...".  When you see this message, hit 
your F5 key.  This will bypass your AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS thereby 
allowing your computer to boot without memory managers and TSRs.

Booting clean using a boot disk
-------------------------------
If you have a version of MS DOS below MS DOS 6.00, then you must create a 
special boot disk.  This boot disk will allow your computer to boot without
any memory managers, drivers, or TSRs.  Here is how you create your boot
disk:
        I.   Find a blank disk and place it in your floppy dirve A:
        II.  Type the command:
                FORMAT A: /S
        III. Once the format is complete, you will have a bootable floppy.

Now, to boot clean from a bootable floppy:
        I.   Place the disk in drive A: and reset your computer.
        II.  Patiently wait while your computer boots from the floppy disk. 
             Once it is finished, you must change to your hard disk drive by
             typing the drive letter.  For example, C:
        III. Enter the directory where you installed Vinyl Goddess From Mars
             ( e.g. CD \VINYL ) and type GODDESS to start the game.

Common Problems and Solutions
ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß

PROB: The game slows downs in some areas
----------------------------------------
Vinyl Goddess From Mars runs at a very high frame rate in order to maintain 
the smoothest scrolling possible on an IBM PC.  As a result, the game may 
slow down slightly on a 386 or very slow 486.  

If you are playing the game under Windows or OS/2, you should run the program
only from MS DOS.  This will give Vinyl Goddess maximum computer power. 

PROB: Sometimes, the game locks up
----------------------------------
This is a sound card related problem.  There are several causes for this:

I.   You are running QEMM with your sound card.  In most cases this will not
     be a problem, however, if the game is locking up because of sound, it
     may be caused by QEMM.  Try playing the game without QEMM. 

II.  One of your TSRs or device drivers is in conflict with Vinyl Goddess 
     From Mars.  For best results, try booting your computer clean.  Please
     refer to the section on booting clean.

III. Some sound cards are not 100% sound blaster compatible.  Vinyl Goddess
     From Mars is written for a 100% sound blaster compatible sound card.  
     Try disabling your sound effects card in the SETUP program and running 
     the game without sound effects.  You should still be able to hear 
     music, but the sound effects will not play.

PROB: The sound effects work when I start the game, but later they stop
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a sound card related problem where you have chosen an incorrect 
sound card IRQ.  Check your sound card documentation and re-run the setup 
program in order to change the IRQ.
