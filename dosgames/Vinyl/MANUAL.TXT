The Official Story    
ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß

In the year 200 billion a small ship races across the galaxy taking The 
Vinyl Goddess From Mars to the esteemed intergalactic B Movie convention. 
In mid transit, a meteor shower strikes without warning and the ship is 
engulfed in a sea of rocks and debris.  Badly damaged by the cosmic storm,
the ship careens off course.  Desperately, The Vinyl Goddess twists knobs and 
pulls levers to regain control.  The best that she can hope for is to eject 
and let the ship crash land on the strange planet below.  It's up to you
to help the lovely goddess find and repair her ship and collect all of her 
belongings before it's to late to reach the convention.

Good luck SPACE CADETS!

Strategy and Playing Tips
ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
The Vinyl Goddess is trapped on a strange and forbidding world with only
her wits and athletic skills to serve her.  She must bounce, jump, run, and 
battle through tricky levels and exciting challenges.  Here are some tips
to survive:

        --> Collect everything.  Many bonuses will augment Vinyl's score.

        --> Collect as many of Vinyl's red accessory capsules as you can find.
            These will add up to large bonuses at the end of the level.

        --> Small green health jugs will rejuvenate Vinyl's health by one
            unit.  Look for the much harder to find large red health jugs.
            These will restore all of Vinyl's health.

        --> Hidden throughout the levels are many secrets waiting to be 
            uncovered.  These often contain huge bonuses.

        --> Search for the mid-level signs.  Once they are spinning, Vinyl 
            will return to these special locations if she dies.

        --> If you are stuck in a certain area in a level, back track and
            look for keys that you may have missed.  Keys are also color
            coded.  For example, a red key will open a red lock.

        --> If you've completed the game several times and are getting tired
            of playing the same levels, register and get the full three 
            episodes.  You'll also get a cool full color poster of the REAL
            Vinyl Goddess and a manual/hint guide.

The far left box on the status bar contains a picture of the current 
weapon.  If Vinyl does not have a weapon, or the current weapon has run
out of energy, this box will be blank.

Weapon Energy
=============
This green bar indicates the current weapon's energy level.  As Vinyl uses
a weapon, energy is expended.  Once the energy has been completely expended, 
Vinyl's weapon will disappear.  There are many different types of weapons
through out the land so look carefully.

Score

These numbers indicate the score Vinyl has accumulated during game play.  By
Collecting fruits, gems and other miscellaneous items you can increase the
score.

These red vinyl capsules are filled with The Vinyl Goddesses personal effects.
These capsules are bonus items and are not needed to complete a level.

Amount
======
This number indicates the amount of capsules that vinyl has collected in 
a given level.

Important Messages Bar
======================
Located in the lower center part of the status bar is a message area. This
area will occasionally relay vital information about Vinyl's health, items
collected and playing tips.

Vinyl Goddess 
=============
This is a photo that Vinyl keeps with her at all times.  She probably took it
at an intergalactic instant photo booth.

Life Points
===========
This bar indicates the status of Vinyl's health.  Each notch in the bar
represents 10% of Vinyl's total health.

All Three Episodes         
ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß

Forests of Old
==============
After a devastating crash, The Vinyl Goddess finds herself alone and lost on
a forbidden, unknown planet.  This first episode takes place largely in the
depths of an ancient forest.  The trees stand gnarled, worn and look extremely
uninviting.  Ruins of a lost civilization dot the land, and in them lurks the
unknown.  You must take control of the Goddess's every move and ultimately 
determine her destiny.

Caverns of Chaos
================
Packs of hideous, flesh eating, fire breathing beasts have plagued Vinyl's
progress from the start.  This episode will prove to be no less perilous.
With the odds stacked steeply against our heroine what chance could she
possibly have?  It will take a brave soul and a will of iron to defeat all
that Vinyl will face in this, the second installment of 'The Vinyl Goddess 
From Mars', trilogy.

The Return
==========
This is the third and final episode in the trilogy.  It is in this episode
that Vinyl will face her greatest challenges.  Vinyl has already explored
much of her immediate surroundings and slain many creatures (all bad of 
course).  This heroine stuff is hard work.  At least the Vinyl Goddess is a 
rugged, well seasoned adventurer.  Well, in the movies she is anyway.  If 
Vinyl does not make it through this last turn of events, she will surly be 
late for the esteemed B movie convention.  Help her please!
