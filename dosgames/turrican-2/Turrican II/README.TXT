    Because of changes in the game within the final phase of
    development, you will find some additional information in this
    document.

        1.1.  Media Vision Pro Audio Support

        * Due to certain incompatibilities between different
          revisions of this soundcard and its drivers, problems
          may occur during the sound output (sometimes the volume
          is much too low). In this case, we recommend using a
          newer version of the MVSOUND.SYS driver or to choose
          the standard Soundblaster card in the sound setup.

        1.2.  Gravis Ultrasound Support

        * There are some special functions needed for the in game 
          music which are not implemented by this sound card.
          These funtions are emulated in a special way. In some
          cases noise or crashes may occur. This problem cannot
          be solved by the software.

        1.3.  Memory Requirements

        * TURRICAN needs a minimum of 540Kb conventional and 2MB of
          extended (XMS) memory

        * HIMEM.SYS must be installed. Other memory drivers like EMM386
          or QEMM386 must not be loaded.

        1.4.  Notebook LCD screens

        * The LCD screen of a Notebook is not capable of emulating
          all the functions of a standard screen. So graphic errors may
          be visible at the edge of the screen. They have no effect to
          the game itself and will not change the gameplay

        2.  Bonus Music Drivers (oversampling devices)

        * Additionally to the normal sound drivers (all the files with
          the extension *.MSD in the TURRICAN directory) there are
          improved sound drivers, which provide a better sound output.
          You just need to start the batch file

          OMD.BAT

          in the turrican directory. To re-install the old drivers start

          MSD.BAT 

        Note: The improved drivers use more  calculations to play 
        the sound. So we recommend you to have at least a 486DX2 
        with 80MHz to use these drivers.
